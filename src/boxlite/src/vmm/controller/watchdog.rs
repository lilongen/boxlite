//! Watchdog for parent death detection.
//!
//! **Unix:** Implements the "pipe trick" — the parent holds the write end of a pipe,
//! the child polls the read end. When the parent dies (or drops the keepalive),
//! the kernel closes the write end, delivering POLLHUP to the child.
//!
//! This is zero-latency, tamper-proof (kernel FDs), and works across
//! PID/mount namespaces — the gold standard used by s6, containerd-shim,
//! runc, crun, and conmon.
//!
//! **Windows:** Uses a named Event object (CreateEventW) + parent process handle.
//! The parent signals the event on explicit stop(); the shim also monitors
//! the parent process handle — when the parent dies, the handle becomes signaled.
//! `WaitForMultipleObjects` watches both simultaneously.
